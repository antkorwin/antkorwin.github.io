## Strong Reference

Strong reference is the most common kind of reference.
We use this kind of reference every day.

For example:
[source, java]
----
Foo firstReference = new Foo();
Foo secondReference = firstReference;

firstReference = null;
secondReference = null;
//Now the GC can collect an instance of the Foo, which created in the first line.
----

The created instance of the Foo class is not available for the garbage collector
while there is at least one link to this object.

## WeakReference

`WeakReference` - this is the type of references
that will be removed by the garbage collector on the next pass,
if there are no other type references to the object.

You can get an object value from the `WeakReference`
until the GC decides to collect the object.
As soon as the GC decides to do it (not after the GC finalize the object and clear an allocated memory),
you will get the NULL from the `WeakReference`.
This happens when the GC is only marking the object for a further processing.
It is important to understand, that all finalization actions are executed only after this.
When we look at the `PhantomReference`, we'll return to this point.

Let's try to testing `WeakReference` behavior:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testWeakAfterGC() {
    // Arrange
    String instance = new String("123");
    WeakReference<String> reference = new WeakReference<>(instance);

    // Act
    instance = null;
    System.gc();

    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(reference.get()).isNull();
}
----

Java provides us the `WeakHashMap` data structure.
It's a something like a `HashMap`,
which uses the `WeakReference` as a key of the Map.
If a key of the `WeakHashMap` becomes garbage, its entry is removed automatically.

How we can test a `WeakHashMap` behavior:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testWeakMap() throws InterruptedException {
    // Arrange
    WeakHashMap<String, Boolean> map = new WeakHashMap<>();
    String instance = new String("123");
    map.put(instance, true);

    // Act
    instance = null;
    System.gc();

    // Asserts
    Thread.sleep(1000);

    Assertions.assertThat(map).isEmpty();
}
----

You might think that this is a good solution for creating a cache,
but you should understand what kind of behavior you need.
Because if we are talking about a cache that removes data from a storage
only when we reached a memory limit, then you should looking at the using of `SoftReferences`.


## SoftReference

The behavior of `SoftReference` is similar to `WeakReference`,
but GC collect this kind of reference only when
our application does not have enough of memory.

Let's try to test it:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void name() {
    // Arrange
    String instance = new String("1234567");
    SoftReference<String> softReference = new SoftReference<>(instance);
    instance = null;
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference).isNotNull();
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference.get()).isNotNull();

    // Act
    allocateAllMemory();

    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference.get()).isNull();
}

private void allocateAllMemory() {
    try {
        Object[] ignored = new Object[(int) Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()];
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
        log.error("exception: ", e);
    }
}
----

The GC collects our `SoftReference` before we get the `OutOfMemoryError`.
This behavior is a good reason to use SoftReferences as a cache for a
data that is difficult to build in memory.

For example, a reading video or graphics data from a slow file storage.
When your application has enough of memory,
you can receive this data from the cache,
but if application reaches of a memory limit, then the cache cleans.
And now, you need restore this data on the next request.

However in many cases you need to prefer a cache based on the LRU algorithm.


## PhantomReference

The `PhantomReferences` are enqueued only when the object is physically removed from memory.

The `get()` method of the PhantomReference always returns `NULL`,
specially to prevent you from being able to resurrect an almost removed object.

The `PhantomReference` provides you an ability to determine exactly when an object was removed from memory.
In order for implementation this we need to work with a `ReferenceQueue`.
When the referent object of a `PhantomReference` removes from a memory
then the GC enqueues the phantomReference in the referenceQueue
and we can poll this reference from this queue.

Let's look at the code:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testQueuePollAfterFinalizationGC() {
  // Arrange
  Foo foo = new Foo();
  ReferenceQueue<Foo> referenceQueue = new ReferenceQueue<>();
  PhantomReference<Foo> phantomReference = new PhantomReference<>(foo, referenceQueue);

  // Act
  foo = null;
  GcUtils.fullFinalization();

  // Asserts
  Assertions.assertThat(phantomReference.isEnqueued()).isTrue();
  Assertions.assertThat(referenceQueue.poll()).isEqualTo(phantomReference);
}

private class Foo {
    @Override
    protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
        System.out.println("FIN!");
        super.finalize();
    }
}
----

NOTE: I use my utility class (`GcUtils`), to test the behavior of phantom references.
This tools are ensure that the GC accurately performs a full cycle of cleaning and finalization.
You can find source code of this utility on my github: link:https://github.com/antkorwin/strong-soft-weak/blob/master/src/main/java/com/antkorwin/strongsoftweak/GcUtils.java[GcUtils.java]

For example, if you need to allocate memory for processing of a large video file,
only after finished processing of a previous file and released allocated memory,
then using a `PhantomReference` is the right decision. Because you can request new memory
after the GC are really release a previous used part and this reduces a chance to get an `OutOfMemoryError`.

Finalization may does not happened in a timely fashion,
it is difficult to predict the number of garbage collection cycles
while the object was waiting for finalization.
It can lead to serious delay in actually cleaning up garbage objects,
and become the reason of you can get an `OutOfMemoryErrors` even when most of the heap is garbage.

We can write own utility to checking for memory leaks, using phantom references:

Example of using this tool:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testWithoutLeaks() {
    // Arrange
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    LeakDetector leakDetector = new LeakDetector(foo);

    // Act
    foo = null;

    // Asserts
    leakDetector.assertLeaksExist();
}

@Test
public void testWithLeak() {
    // Arrange
    Foo foo = new Foo();
    Foo bar = foo;
    LeakDetector leakDetector = new LeakDetector(foo);

    // Act
    foo = null;

    // Asserts
    leakDetector.assertLeaksExist();
}
----

Let's look at the code of the memory leaks detector:

[source, java]
----
public class LeakDetector extends PhantomReference<Object> {

    private final String description;

    /**
     * Initialization of the memory leaks detector.
     * @param referent the object(resource) for which we are looking for leaks.
     */
    public LeakDetector(Object referent) {
        super(referent, new ReferenceQueue<>());
        this.description = String.valueOf(referent);
    }

    /**
     * You must run this method after delete all references on the checkable object(resource)
     * If exists memory leaks then throws a fail.
     */
    public void assertLeaksExist() {
        GcUtils.fullFinalization();

        Assertions.assertThat(isEnqueued())
                  .as("Object: " + description + " was leaked")
                  .isTrue();
    }
}
