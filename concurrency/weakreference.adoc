## Java reference types

* StrongReference

* WeakReference

* SoftReference

* PhantomReference

## StrongReference

StrongReference is the most common kind of reference.
We use this kind of reference every day.

For example:
[source, java]
----
Foo firstReference = new Foo();
Foo secondReference = firstReference;
----

The created instance of the Foo class is not available for the garbage collector
while there is at least one link to this object.

## WeakReference

If the object is accessible only through weak references
then the garbage collector will delete it.

WeakReference - this is the type of references
that will be removed by the garbage collector on the next pass,
if there are no other type references to the object.

Let's try to testing WeakReference behavior:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testWeakAfterGC() {
    // Arrange
    String instance = new String("123");
    WeakReference<String> ref = new WeakReference<>(instance);

    // Act
    instance = null;
    System.gc();

    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(ref.get()).isNull();
}
----

Java provide us a WeakHashMap data structure,
which uses the WeakReference as a key of the Map
and when this reference was finalized(released),
its entry is remove from the Map automatically.

How we can test a WeakHashMap behavior:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void testWeakMap() throws InterruptedException {
    // Arrange
    WeakHashMap<String, Boolean> map = new WeakHashMap<>();
    String instance = new String("123");
    map.put(instance, true);

    // Act
    instance = null;
    System.gc();

    // Asserts
    Thread.sleep(1000);

    Assertions.assertThat(map).isEmpty();
}
----

You might think that this is a good solution for creating a cache,
but you should understand what kind of behavior you need.
Because if we are talking about a cache that removes data from a storage
only when we reached a memory limit, then you should looking at the using of SoftReferences.


## SoftReference

The behavior of SoftReference is similar to WeakReference,
but GC collect this kind of reference only when
our application does not have enough of memory.

Let's try to test it:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void name() {
    // Arrange
    String instance = new String("1234567");
    SoftReference<String> softReference = new SoftReference<>(instance);
    instance = null;
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference).isNotNull();
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference.get()).isNotNull();

    // Act
    allocateAllMemory();

    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(softReference.get()).isNull();
}

private void allocateAllMemory() {
    try {
        Object[] ignored = new Object[(int) Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory()];
    } catch (OutOfMemoryError e) {
        log.error("exception: ", e);
    }
}
----

GC collect our SoftReference before we get the OutOfMemoryError.
This behavior is a good reason to use SoftReferences as a cache for a
data that is difficult to build in memory.

For example, reading video or graphics data from the slow file system.
While the application has enough memory, you can receive this data from
the cache, but if you reach of a memory limit then the cache is cleaned.
And now, you need restore this data on the next request.

However in many cases you need to prefer LRU.
