## Intro

Sometimes we need to synchronize some blocks of a code by the value of variable.

In order to understand this problem, we will consider a simple banking application
which makes the following operations on the each transfer of money by the client:

. evaluates the amount of the cash-back by the transaction in an external web service (CashBackService)

. performs transaction of a money transfer in the database (AccountService)

. updates the data in the cash-back evaluation system  (CashBackService)


The base components of the application are shown on the next diagram:

image:./scheme.png[component diagram of the application]

{empty} +

I tried to make an example as clear as possible.
The transfer of money in the payment service depends on the other two services:

- The first one is a CashBackService that interacts with another web application under the REST protocol.
And in order to calculate the actual cash-back, we need to synchronize transactions with this application.
Because the next amount of the cash-back may depend on the total amount of user payments.

- The second is a AccountService that communicates with an internal DataBase and store a data relate to accounts of users.
In this service we can use a JPA transactions for making some actions as atomic operations in a DataBase.

In a real life, I'd will strongly recommend to you refactoring such systems to avoid such situations as much as possible.
But in our example, imagine that we have no choice.


Let's look at the draft code of this application:


[source, java]
----
@Service
public class PaymentService {

    @Autowired
    private ExternalCashBackService externalCashBackService;

    @Autowired
    private AccountService accountService;

    public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
        synchronized (userId) {  <4>
            Result result = externalCashBackService.evaluateCashBack(userId, amountOfMoney); <1>
            accountService.transfer(userId, amountOfMoney + result.getCashBackAmount()); <2>
            externalCashBackService.cashBackComplete(userId, result.getCashBackAmount()); <3>
        }
    }
}


@Service
public class ExternalCashBackService {

    @Autowired
    private RestTemplate restTemplate;

    public Result evaluateCashBack(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
        return sendRestRequest("evaluate", userId, amountOfMoney);
    }

    public Result cashBackComplete(UUID userId, int cashBackAmount) {
        return sendRestRequest("complete", userId, cashBackAmount);
    }

    private Result sendRestRequest(String action, UUID userId, int value) {

        URI externalCashBackSystemUrl = URI.create("http:/daleko.ko.ko.ko/" + action);

        HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
        headers.set("Accept", MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE);
        RequestDto requestDto = new RequestDto(userId, value);
        HttpEntity<?> request = new HttpEntity<>(requestDto, headers);

        ResponseDto responseDto = restTemplate.exchange(externalCashBackSystemUrl,
                                                        HttpMethod.GET,
                                                        request,
                                                        ResponseDto.class)
                                              .getBody();

        return new Result(responseDto.getStatus(), responseDto.getValue());
    }
}

@Service
public class AccountService {

    @Autowired
    private AccountRepository accountRepository;

    @Transactional(isolation = REPEATABLE_READ)
    public void transfer(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
        Account account = accountRepository.getOne(userId);
        account.setBalance(account.getBalance() - amountOfMoney);
        accountRepository.save(account);
    }
}
----
<1> evaluates the amount of the cash-back by the transaction in an external web service
<2> performs transaction of a money transfer in the database
<3> updates the data in the cash-back evaluation system
<4> synchronization on the instance of UUID



However, you can have several objects with the same value (userId - in the example),
but the synchronization works on the instance of the object and not on its value.

The code below does not work well, because it's incorrectly synchronized,
the static factory method `UUID.fromString(..)` make a new instance of UUID class on the each call,
even if you pass there an equal string argument.

So, we get different instances of the UUID for the equal keys.

[source, java]
----
public void threadA() {
    paymentService.withdrawMoney(UUID.fromString("11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"), 1000);
}


public void threadB() {
    paymentService.withdrawMoney(UUID.fromString("11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555"), 5000);
}
----

In this case you need to obtain a same reference for equals objects to synchronize on it.


## Wrong ways to solve this issue

### Synchronization on methods

You can move synchronized on method:

[source, java]
----
public synchronized void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
    ..
}
----

This solution has bad performance.
You will block transfers of money for absolutely all users.
And if you need to synchronize a different operations in the different classes this solution not helps you at all.


### String intern

In order to ensure that the instance of the class (which contain a user ID)
will be the same in all synchronized blocks,
we can serialize it into a String and use the String.intern() for obtain a same link for equals strings.

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (userId.toString().intern()) {
      ..
  }
}
----

Using intern is not good practice, because the pool of Strings is difficult to clean with the GC.
And your application can consume too many resources while active use of the `String.intern`.

Also, there is a chance that foreign code blocks is synchronized on
the same instance of the string as your application.
This can lead to deadlocks.

WARNING: In general, the use of intern is better left to the internal libraries of the JDK,
there are good articles by link:https://shipilev.net[Aleksey Shipilev] about this point.


## How can we solve this problem correctly?

### Create your own synchronization primitive

We need to implement a behavior that describes on the next diagram:

[plantuml]
....
A -> XSync : lock mutex by **userId **
activate XSync #11DD41
||35|
XSync -> A : release mutex
deactivate XSync

B -> XSync : lock mutex by **userId**
activate XSync #11DD41

A [#red]--> XSync : try to lock by **userId**
activate A #DD3311
note left: wait for \n\
release of \nthe mutex

'A -> A : waiting

XSync -> B : release mutex
deactivate XSync

A -> XSync :\tlock mutex by **userId**
deactivate A
activate XSync #11DD41

XSync -> A : release mutex
deactivate XSync
....

At the first we need to make a new synchronization primitive - the custom mutex.
Which will work by the value of the variable, and not by the reference to the object.

It will be something like a **"named mutex"**, but a little wider,
with the ability to use the value of any object for identification,
not just the value of a String.
You can find examples of synchronization primitives to locking by the name,
in other languages (C++, C#). Now, we will solve this issue in Java.

Something like this:

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (XMutex.of(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}
----

In order to ensure that the same mutexes are obtained
for equals values of variables, we will make the mutex factory.

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (XMutexFactory.get(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}

public void purchase(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney, VendorDescription vendor) {
  synchronized (XMutexFactory.get(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}
----

In order to implement this behavior, we used the WeakReference and the WeakHashMap structure.
I wrote an article about this type of references a week ago, you can consider it in more details here:
link:./weakreference.html[Soft, Weak, Phantom references in Java]

Our mutex factory will be based on the `WeakHashMap`.
The mutex factory creates a new mutex just
if the mutex for this value(key) is not found in the HashMap.
Then created mutex is added to the HashMap.
Using of the `WeakHashMap` allows us to store a mutex in the HashMap while exist any references to it.
And the mutex will be removed from a HashMap automatically when all references to it are released.

We need to use a synchronized version of `WeakHashMap`,
let's see what's described in the link:https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html[documentation] about it:

----
This class is not synchronized. A synchronized WeakHashMap may be constructed
using the Collections.synchronizedMap method.
----

It's very sad and a little later we'll take a closer look at the reason.
But for now, let's consider an example of implementation, which is proposed by the official documentation.


[source, java]
----
public final Map<XMutex<KeyT>, WeakReference<XMutex<KeyT>>> weakHashMap =
            Collections.synchronizedMap(new WeakHashMap<XMutex<KeyT>, WeakReference<XMutex<KeyT>>>());

public XMutex<KeyT> getMutex(KeyT key) {
    validateKey(key);
    return getExist(key)
            .orElseGet(() -> saveNewReference(key));
}

private Optional<XMutex<KeyT>> getExist(KeyT key) {
    return Optional.ofNullable(weakHashMap.get(XMutex.of(key)))
                   .map(WeakReference::get);
}

private XMutex<KeyT> saveNewReference(KeyT key) {

    XMutex<KeyT> mutex = XMutex.of(key);

    WeakReference<XMutex<KeyT>> res = weakHashMap.put(mutex, new WeakReference<>(mutex));
    if (res != null && res.get() != null) {
        return res.get();
    }
    return mutex;
}
----

### What about performance?

If we look at the code of the `Collections.synchronizedMap`
then we find a lot of synchronizations on the global mutex which is
created in pair with a SynchronizedMap instance.

[source, java]
----
SynchronizedMap(Map<K,V> m) {
    this.m = Objects.requireNonNull(m);
    mutex = this;   <1>
}
----
<1> create a mutex while creating a SynchronizedMap instance


And all other methods of the SynchronizedMap are synchronized on this mutex:

[source, java]
----
public int size() {
    synchronized (mutex) {return m.size();}
}
public boolean containsKey(Object key) {
    synchronized (mutex) {return m.containsKey(key);}
}
public V get(Object key) {
    synchronized (mutex) {return m.get(key);}
}
public V put(K key, V value) {
    synchronized (mutex) {return m.put(key, value);}
}
public V remove(Object key) {
    synchronized (mutex) {return m.remove(key);}
}

...

----

NOTE: This solution does not have the best performance.
All of these synchronizations are lead us to permanent locks on each operations with a factory of mutexes.


### ConcurrentHashMap with a WeakReference as a key

We need to look at the using of the `ConcurrentHashMap`.
It has a better performance than Collections.synchronizedMap.

But we have a one problem - the `ConcurrentHashMap` doesn't allow a using of weak-references.

This means that the garbage collector can not delete unused mutexes.
I found two ways to solve this problem:

* The first is to create my own `ConcurrentMap` implementation. +
This is the right decision, but it will take a very long time.
* The second one is the use of the `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap` implementation from the Spring Framework. +
This is a good implementation, but it has a couple of nuances.
We will consider them below.

Let's change the XMutexFactory implementation to use a `ConcurrentReferenceHashMap`:

[source, java]
----
public class XMutexFactory<KeyT> {

  /**
   * Create mutex factory with default settings
   */
  public XMutexFactory() {
      this.map = new ConcurrentReferenceHashMap<>(DEFAULT_INITIAL_CAPACITY,
                                                  DEFAULT_LOAD_FACTOR,
                                                  DEFAULT_CONCURRENCY_LEVEL,
                                                  DEFAULT_REFERENCE_TYPE);
  }

  /**
   * Creates and returns a mutex by the key.
   * If the mutex for this key already exists in the weak-map,
   * then returns the same reference of the mutex.
   */
  public XMutex<KeyT> getMutex(KeyT key) {
      return this.map.compute(key, (k, v) -> (v == null) ? new XMutex<>(k) : v);
  }

}
----

That's cool! +
Less code, but more performance than before. Let's try to check performance of this solution.


### Create a simple benchmark

I made a small benchmark in order to select an implementation.

There are three implementation of the Map involved in test:

* Collections.synchronizedMap based on the WeakHashMap
* ConcurrentHashMap
* ConcurrentReferenceHashMap

I use the ConcurrentHashMap in benchmark just for comparing in measurements,
this implementation is not suitable for use in the factory of mutexes,
because it not support a using of weak or soft references.

All benchmarks are written with using the JMH library.

----

In this micro-benchmark, I create a situation when several threads computes value in the map.
You can consider the source code of this benchmark in more details here
https://github.com/antkorwin/concurrent-map-benchmark/blob/master/src/test/java/com/antkorwin/concurrenttests/ConcurrentMapMicroBenchmark.java[Concurrent Map benchmark]


Put it on the graph:

image:./bench_result.png[benchmark result]


So, the ConcurrentReferenceHashMap justifies its use in this case.

## Getting started with XSync library

I packed this code into the https://github.com/antkorwin/xsync[XSync] library,
and you can use it as a ready solution for the synchronization on value of variable.

In order to do it, you need to add next dependencies:

[source , xml]
----
<repositories>
	<repository>
		<id>jitpack.io</id>
		<url>https://jitpack.io</url>
	</repository>
</repositories>

<dependency>
	<groupId>com.github.antkorwin</groupId>
	<artifactId>xsync</artifactId>
	<version>0.5</version>
</dependency>
----

Then you be able to create instances of the XSync class for a synchronization on types that you need.
For the Spring Framework you can make them as beans:

[source, java]
----
@Bean
public XSync<UUID> xSync(){
    return new XSync<>();
}
----

And now, you can use it:

[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private XSync<UUID> xSync;

public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  xSync.execute(userId, () -> {
      Result result = externalPolicySystem.validateTransfer(userId, amountOfMoney, WITHDRAW);
      accountService.transfer(userId, amountOfMoney, WITHDRAW);
  });
}

public void purchase(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney, VendorDescription vendor) {
  xSync.execute(userId, () -> {
      ..
  });
}
----


## Concurrent tests

In order to be sure that this code works well, I wrote several concurrent tests.

There is an example of one of these tests:

[source, java]
----
public void testSyncBySingleKeyInConcurrency() {
   // Arrange
   XSync<UUID> xsync = new XSync<>(); <1>
   String id = UUID.randomUUID().toString();
   NonAtomicInt var = new NonAtomicInt(0);

   // Act
   IntStream.range(0, THREAD_CNT)
            .boxed()
            .parallel()
            .forEach(j -> xsync.execute(UUID.fromString(id), var::increment));  <2>

   // Asserts
   await().atMost(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
          .until(var::getValue, equalTo(THREAD_CNT));

   Assertions.assertThat(var.getValue()).isEqualTo(THREAD_CNT);
}

@Getter
@AllArgsConstructor
private class NonAtomicInt {  <3>
    private int value;

    public int increment() {
        return value++;
    }
}
----
<1> Create a XSync instance for a synchronization by UUID value.
<2> There is a magic here, we created a parallel stream
and try to increment the same nonatomic integer variable in the each stream.
<3> Implementation of the not thread safe integer variable.

Let's see at the result of the test:
