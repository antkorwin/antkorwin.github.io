## Intro

Sometimes we need to synchronization some blocks of code by the value of variable, for example Id of the entity.

Let's look at the next example:

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (userId) {
      Result result = externalPolicySystem.validateTransfer(userId, amountOfMoney, WITHDRAW);
      if(result.getStatus() != OK) {
        throw new UnreachableTransfer(result);
      }
      accountService.transfer(userId, amountOfMoney, WITHDRAW);
  }
}
----

## Wrong ways to solve this issue

### synchronization on methods

you can move synchronized on method:

[source, java]
----
public synchronized void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
    ..
}
----

This solution has bad performance.
You will block the money transfer for absolutely all users.


### String.intern

In order to ensure that the instance of the class with the user ID
is the same in all synchronized blocks,
we can serialize it into a String and use the String.intern().

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (userId.toString().intern()) {
      ..
  }
}
----

Using intern is not good practice, because the pool of Strings is difficult to clean with the GC.
And with the active use of such synchronizations, your application can consume too many resources.

Also, there is a chance that foreign code blocks is synchronized on
the same instance of the string as your application.
This can lead to deadlocks.

In general, the use of intern is better left to the libraries of the JDK,
there are good articles by Aleksey Shipilev about this point.



## Create your own synchronization primitive

We need to implementation of the next diagram:

[plantuml]
....
A -> XSync : lock mutex by **userId **
activate XSync #11DD41
||35|
XSync -> A : release mutex
deactivate XSync

B -> XSync : lock mutex by **userId**
activate XSync #11DD41

A [#red]--> XSync : try to lock by **userId**
activate A #DD3311
note left: wait for \n\
release of \nthe mutex

'A -> A : waiting

XSync -> B : release mutex
deactivate XSync

A -> XSync :\tlock mutex by **userId**
deactivate A
activate XSync #11DD41

XSync -> A : release mutex
deactivate XSync
....

At the first we need to make a synchronization primitive - the custom mutex.
Which will work by the value of the variable, and not by the reference to the object.

Something like this:

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (XMutex.of(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}
----

In order to ensure that the same mutexes are obtained
for equal values of variables, we will make the mutex factory.

[source, java]
----
public void withdrawMoney(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney) {
  synchronized (XMutexFactory.get(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}

public void purchase(UUID userId, int amountOfMoney, VendorDescription vendor) {
  synchronized (XMutexFactory.get(userId)) {
      ..
  }
}
----

In order to implementation this behavior we used WeakReference and WeakHashMap.
I wrote an article about this type of references a month ago, you can consider this in more details here: http...




### WeakReference map + concurrency

## Concurrency tests
