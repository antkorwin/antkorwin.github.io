## Preamble

The CTO of our company sent me an interesting case of a configuration, last night.
He not fears coding something unusual, this is a good trait for a chief.

He wanted to make a one bean depends on another,
and the first of them should created only if he set a certain property.
Of course in this case the second bean should not be created.

## Let's try to code this.

We need to define a two objects:

[source, java]
----
@Slf4j
@Getter
public class Foo {

    private String value = "ops";

    public Foo() {
        log.warn("new Foo()");
    }
}

@Slf4j
@Getter
public class Bar {

    private Foo foo;
    private String value = "dev";

    public Bar(Foo foo) {
        this.foo = foo;
        this.value += foo.getValue();
        log.warn("new Bar({})", foo);
    }
}
----

Then we make a first configuration file:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
public class FooConfig {

    @Bean
    public Foo foo() {
        return new Foo();
    }
}
----

And a second config, which depends on the first:

[source, java]
----
@Configuration
@ConditionalOnBean(name = "foo")
public class BarConfig {

    @Bean
    public Bar bar(Foo foo) {
        return new Bar(foo);
    }
}
----

Write a simple test for this configuration:

[source, java]
----
@SpringBootTest
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
public class ConfigTest {

    @Autowired
    private Foo foo;

    @Autowired
    private Bar bar;

    @Test
    public void simpleTest() {
        Assertions.assertThat(foo).isNotNull();
        Assertions.assertThat(bar).isNotNull();
    }
}
----

And what we got as a result - `No qualifying bean of type 'Bar'`

## Read the documentation

It's boring, but this is the simplest way to know how to do what you want.
Open a javadoc about the `ConditionalOnBean`:
link:https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/api/org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/condition/ConditionalOnBean.html[https://docs.spring.io/ConditionalOnBean.html]

And what we see?

[quote, Phillip Webb]
`The condition can only match the bean definitions that have been processed by the
application context so far and, as such, it is *strongly recommended* to use this
condition on *auto-configuration classes only*. If a candidate bean may be created by
another auto-configuration, make sure that the one *using this condition runs after*.`

What does it mean for us:

- we need to make our configuration classes as auto-configuration

- the `BarConfig` must be processed after the `FooConfig`.

## How to make auto-configuration class

You need to ...

## How to change the order of processing a configurations

We have an ability to define a dependency between two configuration files.
We can do this by using one of the following annotations:

* `@AutoConfigureAfter`

* `@AutoConfigureBefore`
