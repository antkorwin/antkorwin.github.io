## Exception handling

When you work with state machines, you often take care of errors, which may happen in business logic layer.

### Error in action

Let's consider what happens if an error occurs during the execution of the action:

[source, java]
----
@Override
public void configure(StateMachineTransitionConfigurer<States, Events> transitions) throws Exception {
		transitions.withExternal()
				.source(States.BACKLOG)
				.target(States.DONE)
				.action(failAction())
				.event(Events.ROCK_STAR_DOUBLE_TASK);
}

private Action<States, Events> failAction() {
		return context -> {
				throw new RuntimeException("fail in action");
		};
}
----

Then we make a test:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void failInActionTest() {
    // Act
    stateMachine.sendEvent(ROCK_STAR_DOUBLE_TASK);
    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(stateMachine.getState().getId())
              .isEqualTo(States.BACKLOG);
}
----

Result of the test:

image:failed_action.png[failed action test result]

We are trying to make a transition with failed action.
And we see this exception in log,
but it not thrown to the place of the call.
Because spring state machine handle all runtime exceptions.

### Error in guard check

Let's try to make exception in the guard.

Add a new transition:

[source, java]
----
transitions.withExternal()
           .source(States.BACKLOG)
           .target(States.DONE)
           .event(Events.START_FEATURE)
           .guard(failGuard());
----

and failed guard:

[source, java]
----
private Guard<States, Events> failGuard() {
    return context -> {
        throw new RuntimeException("fail in Guard");
    };
}
----

Now we can write a test:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void failInGuardTest() {
    // Act
    stateMachine.sendEvent(START_FEATURE);
    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(stateMachine.getState().getId())
              .isEqualTo(States.BACKLOG);
}
----

After that we seeing in log the same behavior:

image:failed_guard.png[failed guard]

Exception thrown, but we can't catch it on the place of the call.
The state machine didn't move to the target state, this is expected behavior.
The throw of exception while checking guard condition is equals to returned false by guard.

### Indication of state machine errors

Spring state machine have a not rich functionality for working with errors.
We can set error in actions or guards, but we can't get type of error later.
We can only check for an error, but not the type of exception.

let's see example:

[source, java]
----
transitions.withExternal()
           .source(States.BACKLOG)
           .target(States.DONE)
           .action(actionWithInternalError())
           .event(Events.FINISH_FEATURE);
----

We set error in this action, by creating concrete type of exception:

[source, java]
----
private Action<States, Events> actionWithInternalError() {
    return context -> {
        context.getStateMachine()
               .setStateMachineError(new RuntimeException("fail in Action"));
    };
}
----

Let's try to check it:

[source, java]
----
@Test
public void internalFailTest() {
    // Check precondition
    Assertions.assertThat(stateMachine.hasStateMachineError()).isFalse();
    // Act
    stateMachine.sendEvent(FINISH_FEATURE);
    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(stateMachine.getState().getId())
              .isEqualTo(States.DONE);

    Assertions.assertThat(stateMachine.hasStateMachineError()).isTrue();
}
----

This test was successfully passed.

Before we sent the event in the state machine, it did not have errors.
And after this transition we got an error by using `hasStateMachineError` method.
However, the state machine successfully moved to the target state.

The interface of StateMachine is not provide any methods for the getting type of exception.
It is strange, but you can make workaround for this by using variables of state machine.



## How to resolve available events from the current state

Sometimes you need to evaluate a list of available transitions from the current state of the state machine.
Unfortunately, the spring state machine has not internal methods for this case.
But you can solve this problem yourself:

[source, java]
----
public List<EventsT> getAvailableEvents(StateMachine<StatesT, EventsT> stateMachine) {

    return stateMachine.getTransitions()
                       .stream()
                       .filter(t -> isTransitionSourceFromCurrentState(t, stateMachine))
                       .filter(t -> evaluateGuardCondition(stateMachine, t))
                       .map(Transition::getTrigger)
                       .map(Trigger::getEvent)
                       .collect(toList());
}
----

In this code we find all transitions from the current state
and trying to check guards on this transitions.
If the guard returns false or throws the exception
then we skip this event.

You can find the full source code on github
(link:https://github.com/antkorwin/statemachine/blob/master/src/main/java/com/antkorwin/statemachine/statemachine/resolver/StateMachineResolverImpl.java[StateMachineResolverImpl.java])


for example:

[plantuml]
....
[*] --> CROSSROADS
CROSSROADS --> TARGET : LEFT
CROSSROADS --> TARGET : RIGHT     \n
CROSSROADS --> TARGET : FLY_UP  \n**flyingGuard()**

TARGET --> [*]
....

if we request the list of available events in the `CROSSROADS` state
then we got a list consist of the `LEFT`, `RIGHT`.
In addition the list will contain the event `FLY_UP` if condition `flyingGuard` is true.

Example of using the `StateMachineResolver`:

[source, java]
----
@Autowired
private StateMachineResolver<States, Events> stateMachineResolver;

@Test
public void testResolverWithoutGuard() {
    // Act
    List<Events> availableEvents = stateMachineResolver.getAvailableEvents(stateMachine);
    // Asserts
    Assertions.assertThat(availableEvents)
              .containsOnly(Events.LEFT,
                            Events.RIGHT);
}
----
